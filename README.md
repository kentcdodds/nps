## The problem

Even though npm scripts have a ton of advantages ([learn more][scripts-advantages]), it can grow into an
[unmaintainable mess][mess] in your `package.json` file. Part of the problem is we're configuring scripts in `json`
which has fundamental issues (like no comments).

## This solution

Put all of your scripts in a file called `package-scripts.js` and use `p-s` in a single `package.json` script:

**package.json**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "package-scripts"
  }
}
```

**package-scripts.js**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  scripts: {
    lint: 'eslint .',
    test: {
      default: 'ava',
      watch: {
        script: 'ava -w',
        description: 'run in the amazingly intelligent AVA watch mode'
      }
    },
    build: {
      default: 'webpack',
      prod: 'webpack -p',
    }
  }
}
```

Then you can run:

```console
npm start lint
npm start test.watch
```

But the fun doesn't end there! You can use a prefix:

```console
npm start b # will run the build script
```

And these prefixes can go as deep as you like!

```console
npm start b.p # will run the production build script
```

And if you want to speed things up even more, you can install [`npm-quick-run`][quick-run] and then:

```console
nr s build.prod
```

Cool stuff right? And there's more on [the roadmap][roadmap].

**Also** check out the [examples][examples]. You'll find some good stuff in there (including how to deal with windows
and other cross-platform issues).

**Note:** You don't have to use the `start` script of course. If you're writing a node application, you're likely using
this for starting your server. You could easily create a `p-s` script and do: `npm run p-s b`.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and should
be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```
npm install --save-dev p-s
```

## API

### CLI

The CLI is fairly simple. It allows for a few options. The `p-s` binary is available in your `node_modules/.bin`
directory when you install it locally in a project so you can use it in your `npm` scripts. We also expose a
`package-scripts` alias binary so you can use that as well if you'd like the script to be [more clear][clarity].

```console
$ p-s --help

  Usage: p-s [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help                                  output usage information
    -V, --version                               output the version number
    -s, --silent                                Silent p-s output
    -p, --parallel <script-name1,script-name2>  Scripts to run in parallel (comma seprated)
    -c, --config <filepath>                     Config file to use (defaults to nearest package-scripts.js)

Available scripts (camel or kebab case accepted)

lint - Lint all files with eslint. Configuration is in package.json - eslint .
test - Run tests with AVA. See package.json for config - ava
test.watch - Run in the amazingly intelligent AVA watch mode - ava -w
build - The normal webpack UMD build for development - webpack
build.prod - The production webpack build - webpack -p
```

#### help

Will print out the help you see above (the available scripts are colored üåà and come from the config specified/default
config).

#### silent

By default, `p-s` will log out to the console before running the command. You can add `-s` to your command to silence
this.

#### parallel

Run the given scripts in parallel. This enables handy workflows like this:

```console
npm start -p lint,build,cover && npm start check-coverage && npm start report-coverage
```

#### config

Use a different config

```
npm start -c ./other/package-scripts.js lint
```

Normally, `p-s` will look for a `package-scripts.js` file and load that to get the scripts. Generally you'll want to
have this at the root of your project (next to the `package.json`). But by specifying `-c` or `--config`, `p-s` will
use that file instead.

#### args

You can pass additional arguments to the script(s) that are being spawned:

```console
npm start lint --fix # --fix will be passed on to the lint script
```

#### scripts

If you don't use `-p` (because you don't need parallelism) then you can simply provide the name of the script like so:

```console
npm start cover
```

That's all for the CLI.

### package-scripts.js

`p-s` expects to your `package-scripts.js` file to `module.exports` an object with the following properties:

#### scripts

This can be an object or a function that returns an object. See the annotated example below for what this object can
look like (and different ways to run them):

```javascript
module.exports = {
  scripts: {
    // you can assign a script property to a string
    simple: 'echo "this is easy"', // npm start simple
    test: {
      default: {
        script: 'echo "test things!"', // npm start test
        description: 'just pass it on to npm... Do not take this config very seriously :-)',
      },
      otherStuff: {
        // this one can be executed two different ways:
        // 1. npm start test.otherStuff
        // 2. npm start test.other-stuff
        script: 'echo "testing other things"',
        description: 'this is a handy description',
      },
    },
    // this one can be executed a few different ways:
    // 1. npm start k
    // 2. npm start kebab-case
    // 3. npm start kebabCase
    'kebab-case': 'echo "kebab-case"'
  },
}
```

Remember, I find it considerably nicer to just use [`npm-quick-run`][quick-run] and then I can do:

```console
nr s k # runs npm start kebab-case
```

#### options

This object is used to configure `p-s` with the following options:

##### silent

Setting this to `true` will prevent `p-s` from outputting anything for your script (normally you'll get simple output
indicating the command that's being executed).

## Inspiration

This was inspired by [a tweet][tweet] by [@sindresorhus][sindre].

## Other Solutions

- [scripty][scripty] has a solution for this problem as well. The reason I didn't go with that though is you still need
a line for every script (one of the pains I'm trying to solve) and a each script requires its own file (one of the
benefits of npm scripts I wanted to keep).
